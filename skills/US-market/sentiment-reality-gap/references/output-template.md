## Individual Stock Profile Template

Use this structure for each identified company:

---

### [Rank]. [Company Name] ([Ticker] — [Exchange])

**Sector**: [Sector] | **Industry**: [Industry] | **Market Cap**: [Amount]
**Gap Score**: [Score] — [Extreme / Large / Moderate] | **Issue Type**: [Temporary / Cyclical / Narrative-driven]

#### Current Negative Narrative

[2–4 bullet points summarizing the prevailing bearish thesis:]

- What is the dominant negative story in the market
- Key events or data points driving the narrative
- How widely this narrative has spread (analyst consensus, media saturation, retail sentiment)
- When the negative sentiment began and how it has evolved

#### Sentiment Indicators

| Indicator | Current | Historical Avg | Assessment |
|-----------|---------|---------------|------------|
| Price vs. 52-week high | -—% | — | — |
| Short interest (% float) | —% | —% | ⬆️ Elevated / ➡️ Normal |
| Put/call ratio | — | — | ⬆️ Bearish / ➡️ Neutral |
| Analyst consensus | — | — | ⬇️ Downgraded / ➡️ Stable |
| Institutional ownership Δ (QoQ) | —% | — | ⬇️ Outflows / ➡️ Stable |
| **Composite Sentiment Score** | **—/5** | | **Heavily Negative** |

#### Actual Financial Performance

[Contrast the narrative with the numbers:]

| Metric | Latest | Prior Year | 3Y Avg | Narrative Claim |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Revenue growth | —% | —% | —% | "Revenue is collapsing" → Actually: [reality] |
| EPS | $— | $— | $— | "Earnings are plummeting" → Actually: [reality] |

**Classification**: [Temporary / Cyclical / Narrative-driven]

[2–3 bullet points explaining why the issue is NOT structural:]

- Evidence that the headwind is finite or cyclical
- Management actions to address the issue
- Historical precedent of similar situations resolving
- Forward indicators suggesting stabilization or improvement

**What would change this assessment**: [1–2 conditions under which the issue WOULD become structural — intellectual honesty check]

|--------|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|
