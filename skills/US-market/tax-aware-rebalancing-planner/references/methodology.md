# Methodology (Draft)

This file captures metric definitions, thresholds, edge cases, and common failure modes. When refining, prioritize: field mappings, threshold rationale, and sample periods.

## Data Definitions

- Sources and field mapping (yfinance / SEC EDGAR / FRED / etc.): [TODO]
- Frequency and windows (daily/weekly/quarterly): [TODO]

## Core Metrics

- Metric list and formulas: [TODO]
- Standardization (z-scores, ranks, percentiles): [TODO]

## Signals and Thresholds

- Trigger / exit / invalidation conditions: [TODO]
- Threshold rationale (historical distribution, sector differences): [TODO]

## Edge Cases and Degradation

- Missing data / outliers handling: [TODO]
- Fallback proxies when a data source is unavailable: [TODO]
