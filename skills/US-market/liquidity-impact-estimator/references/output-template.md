## 1) Executive Summary (3–5 bullets)

- **Order size assessment**: [Position size] represents [X]% of [ADV20/ADV60], indicating [low/moderate/high] liquidity impact risk
- **Estimated execution cost**: Expected implementation shortfall of [X-Y] bps based on current volatility and spread conditions
- **Liquidity regime**: [Stock/sector] liquidity is [improving/stable/deteriorating] vs historical norms; [ADV percentile] percentile
- **Execution recommendation**: [Immediate execution feasible / Extend execution over N days / Reduce position size to X% ADV]
- **Key risk**: [Primary concern, e.g., "Recent volume decline increases tail risk" or "Wide spreads suggest limit orders over market orders"]

## 5) Next Steps

- **Monitor liquidity**: Track ADV and spread conditions daily; re-evaluate if ADV drops >= 20% or spreads widen materially
- **Execution strategy**: [Specific recommendation, e.g., "Use VWAP algo over 3-5 days" or "Split into 3 tranches with limit orders"]
- **Alternative venues**: Consider [dark pools / block trading desks / direct indexing] if available to reduce market impact
- **Position sizing**: If impact exceeds [X] bps, consider reducing target position to [Y]% of ADV or extending horizon to [Z] days
- **Contingency plan**: Set maximum acceptable slippage threshold; if exceeded, pause execution and reassess
