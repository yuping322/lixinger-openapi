## 1) Executive Summary (3–5 bullets)

- **Valuation regime**: [Market/sector] is currently [cheap/neutral/expensive] at [Xth] percentile of historical valuation range
- **Forward return expectation**: Based on current valuation, expected [3-year/5-year] annualized return is [X-Y]% (vs historical avg of Z%)
- **Mean reversion signal**: Valuation is [X] standard deviations from mean; [high/moderate/low] probability of reversion over [timeframe]
- **Sector dispersion**: Valuation spread between cheapest and most expensive sectors is [wide/normal/narrow], indicating [opportunity/risk]
- **Key risk**: [Primary concern, e.g., "Earnings growth may not support current multiples" or "Rates rising faster than expected"]

## 5) Next Steps

- **Monitor earnings**: Track [earnings growth / margin trends / guidance] to validate valuation assumptions
- **Positioning**: If valuation is extreme (>= 90th percentile), consider [reducing exposure / adding hedges / rotating to cheaper sectors]
- **Update frequency**: Re-evaluate valuation regime [quarterly after earnings season / monthly / when multiples move >= X%]
- **Scenario analysis**: Test sensitivity to [earnings growth / interest rate / risk premium] assumptions
- **Relative value**: Compare [sector/stock] valuation to [peers / historical range / international markets] for confirmation
