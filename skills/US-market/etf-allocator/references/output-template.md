# Output Template (Draft)

> Goal: readable for humans, reusable for follow-on workflows.

## 1) Executive Summary (3–5 bullets)

- **Allocation recommendation**: [Proposed ETF portfolio] with [X]% in [categories]; expected return [Y]%, volatility [Z]%
- **Exposure profile**: [Sector/factor tilts vs benchmark]; [overweight/underweight] in [specific exposures]
- **Risk assessment**: Portfolio concentration (HHI: [X]), effective holdings ([N]), tracking error ([Y]% vs benchmark)
- **Liquidity check**: [All positions liquid / X% in lower-liquidity ETFs]; estimated rebalancing cost [Y] bps
- **Key trade-off**: [Specific consideration, e.g., "Higher expected return but +2% tracking error" or "Lower cost but less diversification"]

## 5) Next Steps

- **Implementation**: Execute allocation over [timeframe]; use [limit orders / VWAP / rebalancing schedule]
- **Monitoring**: Track [sector drift / factor exposures / tracking error] [daily/weekly/monthly]
- **Rebalancing**: Set rebalancing triggers at [+/- X% drift from target] or [quarterly/semi-annual] calendar schedule
