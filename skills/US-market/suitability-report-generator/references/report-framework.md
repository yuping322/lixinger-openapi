## Risk Taxonomy

### Systematic (Market-Wide) Risks

| Risk | Description | Typical Disclosure Language |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Equity market risk | Broad market decline | "Equity investments are subject to market risk and may decline in value during market downturns" |
| Interest rate risk | Rising rates → bond/stock repricing | "Rising interest rates may cause bond prices to decline and may negatively impact rate-sensitive equities" |
| Inflation risk | Purchasing power erosion | "Inflation may erode the real value of investment returns over time" |
| Currency risk | FX movements (international positions) | "International investments are subject to currency fluctuation risk" |
| Recession risk | Economic contraction | "Economic downturns may impact corporate earnings and stock prices" |
| Geopolitical risk | Wars, trade disputes, sanctions | "Geopolitical events may create market volatility and impact specific holdings" |
| Systemic risk | Financial system disruption | "Financial system disruptions may impact all asset classes simultaneously" |

### Unsystematic (Specific) Risks

| Risk | Description | When to Disclose |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Single-stock risk | Individual company failure | Any individual stock position |
| Sector risk | Industry-specific downturn | Sector concentration > 20% |
| Credit/default risk | Bond issuer default | Any corporate bond/HY exposure |
| Liquidity risk | Inability to sell quickly | Small-cap, micro-cap, thinly-traded positions |
| Concentration risk | Overweight in few positions | Top-5 > 40% |
| Manager risk | Active fund underperformance | Any actively managed fund |
| Strategy risk | Specific strategy failure | Factor tilts, thematic bets |

### Behavioral Risks

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Language |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Panic selling | Selling during drawdowns, locking in losses | "Maintaining investment discipline during market downturns is critical to long-term returns" |
| Performance chasing | Buying after strong runs | "Past performance is not indicative of future results" |
| Overconfidence | Excessive risk-taking after gains | "Investment outcomes involve uncertainty regardless of analytical rigor" |
| Anchoring | Holding losers, selling winners | "Periodic portfolio review and rebalancing helps maintain target allocations" |

## Suitability Assessment Framework

### Risk Tolerance Mapping

| Declared Tolerance | Can Accept | Cannot Accept | Appropriate Strategies |
|-------------------|-----------|--------------|----------------------|
| Conservative | -10 to -15% annual decline | > -20% drawdown | Income-focused, high-quality bonds, low-volatility equity |
| Moderate | -15 to -25% annual decline | > -30% drawdown | Balanced, diversified multi-asset |
| Aggressive | -25 to -40% annual decline | > -50% drawdown | Growth-focused, concentrated, higher-risk assets |

### Time Horizon Alignment

| Time Horizon | Appropriate | Inappropriate |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| < 2 years | Money market, short-term bonds, CDs | Individual stocks, long-duration bonds, alternatives |
| 2–5 years | Investment-grade bonds, balanced allocation | Concentrated equity, illiquid alternatives |
| 5–10 years | Diversified equity/bond mix, moderate risk | Very illiquid investments |
| 10+ years | Full equity allocation, alternatives | — (most strategies appropriate) |

### Financial Situation Assessment

| Factor | Green | Yellow | Red |
|--------|-------|--------|-----|
| Emergency fund | 6+ months expenses | 3–6 months | < 3 months |
| Debt situation | No high-interest debt | Some manageable debt | Significant high-interest debt |
| Investment vs net worth | < 30% of liquid net worth | 30–60% | > 60% (or > 20% of total net worth in single position) |
| Income stability | Stable employment/income | Variable income | Income at risk |
| Insurance coverage | Adequate life/health/disability | Some gaps | Significant gaps |

### Experience Level

| Level | Characteristics | Suitability Implications |
|-------|----------------|------------------------|
| Novice | < 2 years investing experience | Limit complexity; emphasize education; avoid derivatives, concentrated positions |
| Intermediate | 2–10 years, basic understanding | Most strategies appropriate with explanation |
| Experienced | 10+ years, sophisticated understanding | Full range of strategies; can assess complex risks |
| Professional | Industry professional | No restrictions based on experience |

## Regulatory Context

### US: SEC Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)

Key requirements for recommendations:
1. **Disclosure obligation** — Material facts about the recommendation, including risks, fees, conflicts
2. **Care obligation** — Reasonable diligence, prudence, skill; understand the investment and the client
3. **Conflict of interest obligation** — Identify and mitigate conflicts
4. **Compliance obligation** — Policies and procedures to achieve compliance

### FINRA Suitability Rule (Rule 2111)

Three types of suitability:
1. **Reasonable-basis** — Suitable for at least some investors
2. **Customer-specific** — Suitable for this particular customer
3. **Quantitative** — Frequency of trading is suitable (if applicable)

### Key Phrases for Documentation

Use these frames to ensure regulatory alignment:

- "Based on the information provided regarding [client]'s risk tolerance, time horizon, and financial situation..."
- "The following risks have been identified and disclosed..."
- "Alternative approaches considered included [X], [Y], and [Z]. The recommended approach was selected because..."
- "This recommendation is consistent with [client]'s stated investment objectives of..."
