# Tech Stock Hype vs Fundamentals Analyzer

Act as a valuation-focused technology analyst. Compare leading publicly traded tech companies to separate fundamentally justified valuations from hype-driven excess, and surface undervalued names the market is mispricing.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Scope

Confirm with the user:

1. **Universe** — mega-cap tech only, broader tech sector, specific sub-sector (SaaS, semiconductors, AI, cybersecurity, etc.), or custom list
2. **Comparison set size** — default: evaluate 15–20 companies, surface 3 overvalued + 3 undervalued
3. **Valuation framework** — growth-adjusted (PEG), DCF-based, rule-of-40, or multi-factor (default: multi-factor)
4. **Time horizon** — current snapshot or trend analysis over 1–3 years

### Step 2: Build the Comparison Set

Gather and compute core metrics for each company. See [references/tech-valuation-framework.md](references/tech-valuation-framework.md) for calculation details and benchmarks.

| Category | Metrics |
|----------|---------|
| Growth | Revenue growth (YoY, 3Y CAGR), forward revenue growth estimates |
| Valuation | P/E, P/S, EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, PEG ratio |
| Profitability | Gross margin, operating margin, net margin, EBITDA margin |
| Operating leverage | Margin expansion trend (are margins improving as revenue scales?) |
| Cash generation | FCF, FCF margin, FCF yield, cash conversion ratio |
| Capital efficiency | ROIC, ROE, revenue per employee, R&D as % of revenue |
| SaaS-specific (if applicable) | NRR, ARR growth, Rule of 40, CAC payback, LTV/CAC |

### Step 3: Plot Growth vs. Valuation

Map each company on a growth-vs-valuation matrix:

```
              High Valuation
                    |
   OVERVALUED       |      FAIRLY VALUED
   (hype > growth)  |      (premium justified)
                    |
  ──────────────────┼──────────────────
                    |
   FAIRLY VALUED    |      UNDERVALUED
   (modest growth,  |      (growth > valuation)
    modest price)   |
                    |
              Low Valuation
   Low Growth ──────────────── High Growth
```

See [references/tech-valuation-framework.md](references/tech-valuation-framework.md) for the quantitative scoring model.

### Step 4: Identify Mispriced Stocks

**3 Overvalued (Priced for Unrealistic Growth)**:
- Valuation multiple implies growth rate significantly above achievable trajectory
- Margins or TAM cannot support the implied revenue path
- Market is extrapolating peak metrics indefinitely

**3 Undervalued (Overlooked Fundamentals)**:
- Trading at a discount to growth and profitability peers
- Margin expansion or business model shift not yet reflected in price
- Overshadowed by larger competitors or suffering from narrative neglect

For each, articulate precisely **what the market is mispricing** and **why**.

### Step 5: Present Results

Present using the structured format in [references/output-template.md](references/output-template.md):

1. **Executive Summary** — Key findings, market themes, biggest mispricings
2. **Full Comparison Table** — All companies with core metrics
3. **Growth vs. Valuation Matrix** — Visual positioning
4. **Overvalued Profiles** — 3 detailed write-ups
5. **Undervalued Profiles** — 3 detailed write-ups
6. **Disclaimers**

## Data Enhancement

## Important Guidelines

- **Growth quality matters**: Not all revenue growth is equal. Distinguish organic vs. acquisition-driven, recurring vs. one-time, expanding TAM vs. market share gains in a shrinking market.
- **Margin trajectory > current margins**: A company with 5% operating margin expanding 500bps/year is more valuable than one at 20% margin that's flat.
- **Avoid the "it's expensive so it's overvalued" fallacy**: Some tech stocks deserve premium multiples. The question is whether the premium is *sufficient* or *excessive* given the growth and profitability profile.
- **AI/narrative premium**: Many tech stocks carry an AI premium. Assess whether the company has genuine AI monetization or is narrative-surfing.
- **Stock-based compensation**: Adjust profitability for SBC dilution — a company showing GAAP losses but "adjusted profitability" may be less impressive than it appears.
- **Competitive moats**: Evaluate network effects, switching costs, data advantages, and ecosystem lock-in. Moats justify higher multiples.
