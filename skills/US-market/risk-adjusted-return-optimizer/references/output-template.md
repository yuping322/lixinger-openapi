## Rebalancing Plan

| Rule | Detail |

| Check frequency | [Quarterly / Monthly] |
| Rebalance trigger | [±5% drift from target / calendar date] |
| Execution preference | [Use new cash first, then trade] |
| Tax-loss harvesting | [Yes — with swap pairs / No] |

### Rebalancing Decision Tree

1. Check each position vs. target at [frequency]
2. If any position drifted ≥ 5% from target → rebalance that position
3. If new cash available → direct to most underweight position
4. If selling → sell most overweight position with highest cost basis
5. If market dropped ≥ 10% → rebalance immediately regardless of schedule

| [Strategy 1] | [Specific detail] | [Scenario] |
| [Strategy 2] | [Specific detail] | [Scenario] |
| [Strategy 3] | [Specific detail] | [Scenario] |

## Implementation Guide

**Order of operations for funding the portfolio:**

1. Open required accounts (brokerage, retirement) if not already open
2. Transfer funds
3. Purchase fixed income positions first (stable while building)
4. Purchase equity core positions (broad index ETFs)
5. Add satellite positions
6. Set up automatic contributions if applicable
7. Set calendar reminders for rebalancing checks
8. Document the investment policy statement for future reference
