> Goal: readable for humans, reusable for follow-on workflows.

## 1) Executive Summary (3–5 bullets)

- **Crowding assessment**: [Factor name] is at [Xth] percentile of historical crowding; [low/moderate/high] reversal risk
- **Dispersion level**: Factor return dispersion is [wide/normal/narrow]; [many/few] stocks scoring similarly indicates [opportunity/risk]
- **Performance trend**: [Factor] has [outperformed/underperformed] over [trailing period]; [momentum/exhaustion] signal
- **Positioning risk**: [X]% of [universe/AUM] is tilted toward [factor]; concentration increases tail risk
- **Recommendation**: [Maintain exposure / Reduce position / Add hedges / Rotate to uncrowded factors]

## 2) Key Data (Table)

## 4) Risks and Monitoring

| Risk | Trigger | Monitor | Mitigation |

## 5) Next Steps

- **Monitor dispersion**: Track factor return spread daily/weekly; alert if dispersion drops below [Xth] percentile (crowding signal)
- **Rebalancing**: If crowding is extreme, consider [reducing factor tilt / diversifying across factors / adding low-correlation strategies]
- **Volatility watch**: Crowded factors are vulnerable in vol spikes; monitor VIX and consider hedges if VIX >= [threshold]
- **Flow analysis**: Track [ETF flows / hedge fund positioning] for early warning of factor unwinds
- **Update frequency**: Re-evaluate crowding [weekly / after major market moves / when dispersion changes >= X%]
