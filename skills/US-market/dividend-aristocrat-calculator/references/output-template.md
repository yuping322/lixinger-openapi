## Disclaimers

> **Disclaimer**: Past dividend performance is not a guarantee of future payments. Dividend Aristocrat status can be lost if a company reduces or suspends its dividend. Total return calculations assume reinvestment at historical prices and do not account for taxes, commissions, or fees. Income projections assume constant dividend growth rates, which are unlikely to persist indefinitely.
