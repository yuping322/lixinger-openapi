## Controversy Assessment

### Severity Classification

| Level | Definition | Examples | Score Impact |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Critical** (Level 5) | Systematic, egregious violations with widespread harm | Environmental disasters, systematic fraud, human rights violations | -30 to -50 points |

| **Moderate** (Level 3) | Notable incidents with limited harm | Regulatory fines, product recalls, discrimination lawsuits | -10 to -20 points |
| **Low** (Level 2) | Minor incidents, proactively addressed | Small fines, individual incidents, resolved complaints | -5 to -10 points |

## ESG Data Sources

### Major ESG Rating Providers

| Provider | Methodology | Coverage | Notes |
|----------|------------|---------|-------|
| MSCI ESG | Industry-relative scoring, key issue focus | 14,000+ companies | Most widely used by institutions |
| Sustainalytics | Risk-based (unmanaged ESG risk) | 16,000+ companies | Focus on downside risk |
| CDP | Questionnaire-based, self-reported | 18,000+ companies | Best for environmental data |
| Bloomberg ESG | Data-driven, 100+ fields | 12,000+ companies | Raw data, less opinionated |
| S&P Global (CSA) | Questionnaire + public data | 10,000+ companies | Feeds DJSI selection |

### Rating Disagreement

ESG ratings from different providers correlate only ~0.50 (vs ~0.99 for credit ratings). This means:
- Don't rely on a single provider
- Cross-reference multiple sources
- Focus on quantitative metrics (emissions data) over subjective scores where possible
- Understand each provider's methodology and biases
